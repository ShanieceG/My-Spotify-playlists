# My-Spotify-playlists
Converting JSON file containing all my Spotify playlists into an easily accessible data frame

Music is a big part of my life. I listen to music every day during work, doing chores around the house, driving in
my car, etc. I use Spotify premium because I enjoy that I can create my own playlist of my favorite songs and
artists. I like to have a backup of my playlists because I have lost them in the past and it was very frustrating to
create multiple playlists all over again. I wanted an easier way to have a backup on hand so I decided to
create a data frame that I can update yearly.
